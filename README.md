# html_css_js_boilerplate
starting place for any front-end project

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

HTML was used in the skeleton.html boilerplate page to be used as a jumping-off point for new front-end projects.

My biggest achievement is getting the structure set and getting the git repo set up correctly so I can fork it later.

The toughest problem I encountered was getting the javascript tag to show up correctly in Chrome, but was easily fixed.
